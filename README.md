## 3D Rendering Engine

**Description:**
This project is a custom-built 3D rendering engine designed for real-time graphics. The engine features a file parser capable of interpreting obj files exported from Blender, facilitating seamless integration with various 3D models. The current implementation achieves real-time rendering on the screen, laying a solid foundation in computer graphics principles.

**Key Features:**
- **File Parsing:** A robust parser enables the engine to interpret .obj files, ensuring compatibility with models created in Blender.
- **Real-time Rendering:** The engine achieves real-time rendering of 3D models, showcasing a fundamental understanding of computer graphics.

**Planned Enhancements:**
The project is set to undergo further improvements, including:
- **Pipeline Optimization:** Implementation of Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO) and Element Buffer Objects (EBO) for an optimized rendering pipeline.
- **Texture Mapping:** Integration of texture mapping to enhance visual quality.
- **Fragment Shading:** Implementation of fragment shaders for more realistic and detailed graphics.
- **Lighting Techniques:** Integration of various lighting techniques to add depth and realism to rendered scenes.

**Usage:**
- Clone the repository.
- Run the engine with your preferred IDE or compiler.
- Explore the rendered 3D models.
